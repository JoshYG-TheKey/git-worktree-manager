# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A command-line interface tool for managing Git worktrees with an intuitive, interactive interface built using the Rich library. The tool simplifies worktree creation, management, and visualization by providing guided workflows and comprehensive status information. It operates within Git repositories and offers performance-optimized operations for viewing worktree status and diffs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create new worktrees interactively from within any Git repository, so that I can quickly set up isolated working environments for different branches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is executed from within a Git repository THEN the system SHALL present an interactive interface for worktree creation
2. WHEN creating a worktree THEN the system SHALL prompt for a branch name for the new worktree
3. WHEN selecting a base branch THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive list of available branches to choose from
4. WHEN a base branch is selected THEN the system SHALL create the worktree based on that branch
5. IF the specified branch name doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create a new branch from the selected base branch

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure where worktree directories are stored, so that I can organize my worktrees according to my preferred file system structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring worktree storage location THEN the system SHALL allow interactive selection of the directory path
2. WHEN no custom path is specified THEN the system SHALL use a system-wide default location set via environment variable
3. WHEN the environment variable is not set THEN the system SHALL use a sensible default location (e.g., `~/worktrees`)
4. WHEN a storage location is selected THEN the system SHALL persist this preference for future worktree operations
5. IF the specified directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view all my worktrees with comprehensive status information, so that I can quickly understand the state of each working environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing worktrees THEN the system SHALL display a list of all existing worktrees
2. WHEN displaying worktree information THEN the system SHALL show the branch name for each worktree
3. WHEN displaying worktree information THEN the system SHALL show the latest commit hash and message for each worktree
4. WHEN displaying worktree information THEN the system SHALL show the file path location of each worktree
5. WHEN displaying worktree status THEN the system SHALL indicate if the worktree has uncommitted changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see diff summaries between worktree branches and their base branches, so that I can quickly understand what changes exist in each working environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing worktree details THEN the system SHALL display a headline diff summary showing files changed/added/removed
2. WHEN calculating diffs THEN the system SHALL compare the worktree branch against its original base branch
3. WHEN displaying diff information THEN the system SHALL show the number of files modified, added, and deleted
4. WHEN no changes exist THEN the system SHALL indicate the worktree is up-to-date with its base branch
5. IF the base branch information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and show available information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to operate with good performance even in large repositories, so that I can use it efficiently in my daily workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading worktree information THEN the system SHALL complete operations within 2 seconds for repositories with up to 100 worktrees
2. WHEN calculating diff summaries THEN the system SHALL use efficient Git commands to minimize processing time
3. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL use progressive loading for large datasets
4. WHEN performing Git operations THEN the system SHALL cache frequently accessed information where appropriate
5. IF operations take longer than expected THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to have an attractive and intuitive interface using Rich, so that the information is easy to read and the tool is pleasant to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use Rich library components for enhanced visual presentation
2. WHEN showing worktree lists THEN the system SHALL use tables or panels for organized information display
3. WHEN displaying interactive prompts THEN the system SHALL use Rich's interactive components for user input
4. WHEN showing diff information THEN the system SHALL use color coding to distinguish different types of changes
5. WHEN displaying status information THEN the system SHALL use appropriate icons and formatting for quick visual scanning

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to handle error conditions gracefully, so that I can understand and resolve issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executed outside a Git repository THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and exit gracefully
2. WHEN Git operations fail THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages with suggested solutions
3. WHEN worktree creation fails THEN the system SHALL clean up any partially created resources
4. WHEN storage directories are inaccessible THEN the system SHALL provide alternative options or fallback locations
5. IF required Git commands are unavailable THEN the system SHALL check for Git availability and provide installation guidance
